<h3>What You'll Need To Cook</h3>
<p><ul>
<li>Pizza sheet</li>
<li>Pizza peel</li> 
<li>Instant thermometer</li> 
</ul>
</p>

<h3>What You'll Need For The Dough</h3>

<p><ul>
<li>2½ cups of unbleached flour</li>
<li>1 teaspoon of sugar</li>
<li>½ teaspoon of active yeast</li>
<li>¾ teaspoon of salt</li>
<li>A cup of warm water</li>
<li>1 tablespoon of olive oil</li>
<li>All purpose flour</li>
</ul></p>

<h3>What You'll Need For Toppings</h3>

<p><ul>
<li>2 tablespoons of grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese</li>
<li>½ pound of fresh mozzarella cheese</li>
<li>6 large basil leaves</li>

</ul>
</p>


<h2>Making The Dough</h2>
<p>
    <ol>
       <li>To prepare the dough, take a medium bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, sugar, yeast and salt. Add the warm water and olive oil, and stir the mixture with a wooden spoon until the dough just begins to come together.</li>
       <li>Scrape the dough onto a well-floured counter top and knead the dough for three minutes. Dust the dough with flour as needed, it should be slightly tacky, but should not be sticking to your counter top.  After about 3 minutes, the dough should be smooth, slightly elastic, and tacky. Lightly grease a large mixing bowl with olive oil, and place the dough into the bowl.</li> 
       <li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and allow the dough to rise in a warm, dry area of your kitchen for 2 hours or until the dough has doubled in size. </li>
    </ol>
</p>

<h2>Cooking The Pizza</h2>
<p>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the pizza steel (or stone) on the second to top rack of your oven and preheat the oven and steel to 550°F (285°C) for a minumum of 1 hour. If your oven does not go up to 550°F (285°C) or you are using a delicate pizza stone, It is recommended to heat it to a maximum of 500°F (260°C)</li>
        <li>As the oven is preheating, assemble the ingredients. In a small bowl, stir together the pureed tomatoes, minced garlic, extra virgin olive oil, pepper, and salt. Set aside another small bowl with the cubed mozzarella cheese. Set aside the basil leaves and grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese.</li>
        <li>Separate the dough into two equal-sized portions. It will deflate slightly, but that is OK. Place the dough on a large plate or floured counter top, cover gently with plastic wrap, and allow the dough to rest for 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the pizza peel with a tablespoon of semolina and dusting of all-purpose flour. Gently use both hands to stretch one ball of pizza dough into roughly a 10-inch circle. If the dough springs back or is too elastic, allow it to rest for an additional five minutes. The edges of the dough can be slightly thicker, but make sure the center of the dough is thin (you should be able to see some light through it if you held it up). Gently transfer the dough onto the semolina and flour dusted pizza peel or baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Drizzle or brush the dough lightly with olive oil. Using a large spoon, add roughly ½ cup of the tomato sauce onto the pizza dough, leaving a ½-inch or ¾-inch border on all sides. Use the back of the spoon to spread it evenly and thinly. Sprinkle a tablespoon of parmigiano-reggiano cheese onto the pizza sauce. Add half of the cubed mozzarella, distributing it evenly over the entire pizza. Using your hands, tear a few large basil leaves, and sprinkle the basil over the pizza. At this point, I’ll occasionally stretch the sides of the dough out a bit to make it even thinner. Gently slide the pizza from the peel onto the heated baking stone. Bake for 7 to 8 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbling and caramelized and the edges of the pizza are golden brown.</li>
        <li>Remove the pizza carefully from the oven with the pizza peel, transfer to a wooden cutting board or foil, drizzle the top with olive oil, some grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese, and chiffonade of fresh basil. Slice and serve immediately and/or prepare the second pizza.</li>
